title: Sprinkles of JS

Coming soon, yo.
<!-- 
## Why?
Let's say the cupcake (🧁) is a metaphor. The cupcake is a library. The sprinkles are what you _really_ want. You can have the cupcake later.

Framework this, library that. What if you want to do a simple task in JavaScript? Before you reach for a framework (even the ones that are tree-shakable, the ultimate "this is fine" maneuver), take a look here. Look at the function provided. Really take it in.

**Deadlines always factor into the discussion.** But consider the amount of time it might take to read documentation for a library, when really, all you need to do is check if something is an array. Or send a get request.

This site is for you. Definitely inspired by both [@5t3ph's SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev) and [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)

## Note
Sprinkles does not condone using Internet Explorer anymore. If you have to, there are notes for specific use cases in each sprinkle, but for the most part - even this website isn't very compatible with it. -->
